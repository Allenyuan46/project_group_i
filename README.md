### Brief project description

Research Question: How does time series and machine learning models compare in terms of accuracy for electricity demand forecasting to enable better planning for energy providers? 

Description : Based on our preliminary literature review, time series and machine learning are the most used models by researchers. Time series is suitable for short-term prediction in a prompt manner, whilst machine learning is suitable for long-term prediction with synthetic data, hence we have found it interesting to compare both models. As our team members have experience in developing either of the two models, we are justified to compare these two models in our research. Nonetheless, we may add other models to the list subject to the findings in the prospective full literature review. We will conclude our report by advising our target clients on the best prediction model in terms of accuracy.
